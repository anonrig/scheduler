    "summary": "This course provides an opportunity for independent research and development in digital imagery techniques and production concepts on the graduate level. Students work to improve their abilities in the following areas: interactive web design, interactive multimedia, 3-d modeling/animation, videography or print publication design. This course will further develop the student¿s understanding of commercial applied design processes revolving around microcomputer operations. Students are encouraged to identify production areas of interest for in-depth investigation. Emphasis is placed on the student¿s ability to produce imagery from idea generation through final mechanical. Note(s) All courses may be repeated for credit (up to 12 hours). Most studio classes involve self-directed work and individual research with individual faculty members assigned to the area of study.",

    "summary": "An introductory course in the reading and writing of poetry. A premise of this course is that reading and writing are reciprocal activities. A goal of this course is to make that reciprocity legible. To that end, students will learn to read poetry (their own, their classmates, and those of published writers) rhetorically, acquiring two vocabularies, two languages almost; that of poetic practice and prosody, and that of critique.",

    "summary": "This course guides candidates to explore the roles individuals and groups play shaping the dynamic relationship between schools and society. We pay particular attention to issues of social/cultural difference and dominance, and how framing of these issues influences schooling conditions, curriculum, and pedagogical practice. We also consider the converse of how school practices influence understanding of social/cultural difference and dominance (e.g., race, class, gender, disability, and sexuality). We use historical and contemporary examples to illuminate how the answers to the following questions change over time and space: What is the purpose of schooling? How does the institution of schooling in the United States influence individuals. How do cultural groups and/or communities influence US schooling?",

The class brings together material from the philosophy of logic, the philosophy of language, and the philosophy of mind, focusing upon the historical quest to formally understand the nature of reason. To achieve this goal, the class explores: the dream of a logically perfect language, the nature of infinity, paradoxes, the limits of computation, and difference between determinism and predictability. Once some of the limits of reason have been identified and clarified, students explore a range of practical problems where such limits may have significant real-world implications. The course should be of interest to majors in philosophy, psychology, cognitive science, or to anyone curious about the nature and limits of knowledge.",
