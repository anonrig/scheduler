Starting from genomic information and genome organization, DNA structure, packaging to chromosomes, replication of genetic material and its fidelity, mechanisms to repair and recombination of DNA will be discussed in the lecture. RNA structure, mechanisms of DNA transcription to RNA, transcriptional control mechanisms and transcription factors will be studied in detail. RNA to protein translation mechanisms and ribosome structure will be dissected. Protein stability, protein degradation echanisms, role of miRNAs and RNA stability on gene expression will be discussed. A general introduction to programmed cell death mechanims will be presented.The lab course is practical course on principle techniques for production of recombinant proteins in bacteria and animal cells. Lab work will involve utilisation of molecular cloning techniques to produce a particular gene product. Recombinant plasmids carrying either single gene or that for a fusion protein will be constructed and used to transform E. coli, and the gene products will be isolated and characterized.",

My objective in this course is to present a systematic application of strategic marketing in the global environment. I present an integrated treatment of conceptual and managerial issues in contemporary international marketing based on the state-of-the-art research in the field. The focus is on the formulation of comprehensive marketing strategies by multinationals from developed economies, such as the United States, but also from emerging economies, such as India, China, S. Africa, and Turkey, competing in global industries. The course is designed to provide an appreciation for cross-functional and interdisciplinary perspectives in international business. This is because today’s global operations increasingly require these proficiencies in managing core business processes.",

    "summary": "Program debugging is a process of identifying and fixing bugs. Identifying root causes is the hardest, thus the most expensive, component of debugging. Developers often take a slice of the statements involved in a failure, hypothesize a set of potential causes in an ad hoc manner, and iteratively verify and refine their hypotheses until root causes are located. Obviously, this process can be quite tedious and time-consuming. Furthermore, as software systems are getting increasingly complex, the inefficiencies of the manual debugging process are getting magnified. Many automated approaches have been proposed to facilitate program debugging. All these approaches share the same ultimate goal, which is to help developers quickly and accurately pinpoint the root causes of failures. This course will cover state-of-the-art automated debugging approaches from both practical and research perspectives and will consist of two main parts. The goal of the first part is two folds: 1) To turn program debugging from a black art (as many believe) into a systematic and well-organized discipline; and 2) To provide students with enough background information to read and understand the scientific literature. The topics which will be covered in the first part are: How Failures Come To Be, Tracking Problems, Making Programs Fail, Reproducing Problems, Simplifying Problems, Scientific Debugging, Deducing Errors, and Mining and Detecting Anomalies. The second part of the course will survey the related literature by dividing it into four broad categories, namely static- analysis-based, dynamic-analysis-based, model-based, and empirical approaches.",

EDA is distinct from Data Visualization in that EDA is done towards the beginning of analysis and data visualization is done towards the end to communicate one’s finding. This course particularly pays attention to the applied techniques to data visualization narratives. We will draw on case studies from business world, industry to news media.",

Though its birth goes all the way back to the 19th century it is, in this long century that cinema has been the medium of high and low art, the medium of propaganda and popular culture. The show and entertainment business of the last century and the consumer culture came out has both contributed to and benefited from the cinema. On the other hand, cinema has transformed the visual culture dramatically as a matter of visuality. It is after the introduction of the movies of the 1920s that human understanding of visuality has taken a radical shift as a consequence of cinema's relation to various aspects, such as psychoanalysis In this regard cinema might be taken as the basic art of the past century with none of the realms of art and social life being ignorant to it. The course will expose the students to the reality both produced and transformed in cinema. Each week a certain field, such as history, politics, psychoanalysis, gender, marginality, will be selected and accordingly films will be analysed to find out how the reality of that specific area is represented. On the background the students will discuss and analyse the basic concerns and concepts of modernity. The course, in this context, will conjointly survey the history, problematics and arts of the past century as well as the adventure of cinema as a technique and art.",

The long drawn-out tragedy of the Turkish 19th century, comprising: a context of continuing retreat and territorial contraction, as well as of deepening despair, summed up as a non-colonial pattern of incorporation; the complicated relationships between the Great Powers and the various Balkan nationalisms; the initial introduction and the subsequent expansion of modernization agendas from the top down; the interplay of political and economic factors, and of local vs international forces, in the major crises of the 1830s, the 1850s, and the 1870s; the course of restructuring in the legal, administrative, educational, fiscal and economic spheres; the ancien régime complexity set up by Tanzimat dualisms; the Ottomans' ambition to modernize and to be recognized as modern (and hence of being admitted into the Concert of Europe); the gradual emergence of a state of law, and the replacement of the First Constitution's abortive liberalism by the resurgent authoritarianism of the Hamidian era.",

    "summary": "Designed as an introduction to reading and analyzing epic narratives, this course focuses on four such key types of works re-introduced in writing during the Middle Ages : the Shahnama, the Oghuznama, the Alexander Romance, and the Arthurian Legends. Introduced at the outset will be the main themes and narrative tools employed in the construction of epics; the common features which make a “hero”; and the relevant historical contexts. These will then be brought to bear on a close examination of the works in question, with the final case study of Alexander and the Romances serving to explore the common aspects of “Eastern” and “Western” epics and heroes. The course will conclude with a discussion of the afterlife of these epics.",

Building upon research based on the central Ottoman archives over the last three decades, and using the state as the key unit of analysis, the first part of this course takes an in-depth look at people and ideas in the Ottoman territories over 1600-1800, via (1) the changing political economy, (2) the transformation of agrarian relations, (3) the problems of provisioning Istanbul, (4) struggles between the reforming and conservative wings of the ruling elite, and (5) the \"women's sultanate\", so-called, and the changing legitimation patterns of the House of Osman. A second part deals with (6) economic, social and cultural life in the provinces, and (7) the growth of international trading cities such as Thessaloniki, Izmir or Aleppo. In concluding, historiographical attention is devoted to the clichés or tropes of (8) the \"Tulip Age\", (9) \"Oriental despotism\", and (10) \"incorporation into the world- system\".",

The course aims to situate the myriad transformations in Late Ottoman social, political and cultural life not only within their European and Balkan context, but also in relation to the modernizing agendas of the non-western/colonial world. Thus, the Ottoman efforts to salvage the state and to redefine an exclusive imperial identity will be discussed through comparative perspectives and methodological insights provided by current studies on 19th century Austria-Hungary, Russia and Iran, as well as colonial North Africa and India.",

    "summary": "This course will focus on a selected few masterpieces of Ottoman artistic and literary production, picked on the basis of not only their high aesthetic qualities, but also their representativeness across different genres and historical periods. A problem-oriented approach, therefore, may and shall be woven around them, but by starting with the works themselves, and proceeding from them to explore successive and ever-expanding backgrounds, instead of creating a relatively \"complete\" or continuous narrative of cultural history from the outset and submerging a much larger number of works within it. As key examples to be subjected to such close \"readings,\" the following have been tentatively opted for : From the triumphant imperial moment of the 16th century, (1) Mimar Sinan's Süleymaniye mosque and complex; (2) İznik wall-tiles at Rüstem Paşa mosque; and (3) Nakkaş Osman's pictorial eulogy of the dynasty Hünernâme; from the early 18th, late 18th, and early 19th centuries, (4) Levnî's Book of Festivals (Surnâme-i Vehbi); (5) Nedim's poetry; (6) Antoine-Ignace Melling's Hadice Sultan waterfront palace at Defterdarburnu; and (7) Itrî's musical output. It is thereby proposed to introduce students both to a whole range of modes of expression (such as monumental religious architecture, decorative programs of line and colour, the arts of the book, the ruling elite's changing \"theater of life\" and consumption patterns, and the conventions of composition), and to analytical perspectives on two main periods of Ottoman history with their specific power relations, socio-economic problems, ideological re-adjustments, sensitivities and outlooks. In addition to the existing pre-requisite \" to have completed 23 credits\" for this course , a new condition will be added as \"to complete SPS 101 and SPS 102 courses at least with D grade\" as of the Fall semester of 2015-2016 Academic Year. Students who failed from SPS 101 and SPS 102 courses, do not have right to take this course.",

    "summary": "This is a course that aims to develop a practitioner's perspective to management. It is an approach that focuses on the challenges and realities experienced by managers in the process of managing. The students will try to uncover the taken for granted assumptions, the implicit values, and the difference between espoused theories and theories in practice, potential conflicts and surprises in order to identify the determinants of practice of the managers in a specific organization. By being embedded in a specific organization throughout the semester, students will both individually and collectively experience a 'live case'. The course will expose the students to all the benefits of a case study approach yet in a real time and in an interactive manner. The background analysis that will be done before the orientation visit, the team inquiry of a specific business function, the critical examination of all the relevant functional managers practice with the whole class and observing a typical day of the chosen manager, in the same specific organization will enable the students to be part of the organization in a very meaningful and animated manner. These experiences will be discussed during class meetings and the students will be coached into being a 'reflective practitioner' through these discussions. A series of reflection papers to be written individually and within a team, will enable them to understand the broader as well as unique characteristics of practicing management in the context of the chosen company. The technique they will learn as they write the reflection papers and the comprehensive analysis of the 'live case' will help them in managing their projects in the second year of the MBA program. The students will hence learn the process of creating action knowledge by studying and sharing other manager's practice",

    "summary": "Beginning with Newtonian mechanics and Maxwellian electromagnetics, we examine material properties, by considering electrons as particles and light as waves.  In order to understand phenomena that cannot be explained by classical physics, we first develop the tools for understanding the wave-like behavior of electrons and particle- like behavior of light--i.e., quantum mechanics, built around Schrödinger's equation.  A quantum chemical approach is applied to understand molecular bond formation and the electrical and optical properties of conductive polymers.  To examine electrical and optical properties of metals and insulators, solid state models are developed for bulk solids and interfaces, leading to the fundamentals of semiconductor materials and the p-n junction.",

    "summary": "Observing and understanding the workings of nature(comrising the physical universe and living organisms)is fundamental to contemporary civilization.Technology begins with some understanding of how nature works.The natural sciences also provide a most versatile method of using the human intellect Instead of separate gateways to physics,chemistry of biology the science of Nature courses at Sabancı Unıversity propose to selectively introduce some of the basic concepts of our knowledge of nature;to look at natural laws in their interconnectivity ;and to initiate an experience of the way science operates,sharing the method of scientific thinking with students.What are the ideas in science that would be most interesting,enjoyable or useful to know for any,college graduate?How do we probe a scientific question in practise? What constitutes an answer?What are some of the answers that we have -or don't have as yet?How do Newton's Laws of Motion work?What does it mean to have an electric or magnetic field in a vacuum?What is there in the universe?What happens when a system in equilibrium is slightly perturbed?What determines the size and structure of an atom?Why is there a Periodic Table?How does a chemical reaction proceed?What are some of the important molecules in living organisms,and how do they work?What is the structure of DNA and the mechanism of heredity?How do we analyze and determine symmetrical structures in nature,or the structures of molecules and crystals?How do populations of living things interact and change?What is biological evolution?What are the basic mechanisms for the emergence,evolution or extinction of species?What questions make up the current frontiers of science? Emphasis in the science of Nature courses will not be on conveying secondary fragments of knowledge,but on conveying to all students in both Faculties an overall sense of the way science looks at the world,at new problems and at new subjects,while making sure that students who way want to specialize in engineering or the natural sciences are  equipped with the basic concepts and skills necessary for future work.Computer simulations are an integral part of the course ,requiring student interaction ,participation and feedback.This is complemented by hands -on laboratory experiments that will be important for highlighting pitfalls in the way of actual (as opposed to virtual)practice.In the last analysis,science is common sense; it is ''easy'' as common sense is easy;and it discovers a surprising display of beauty in nature.",

    "summary": "The central objective of this course is to introduce students to perspectives on studying management and organisational phenomena. It aims to develop a critical appreciation of the historical evolution and the current state of management and organisation studies. The former part of the course is devoted to charting the domain and concerns of organisational analysis and deals with issues like organisations and their environments, goals and effectiveness, power and control, their and work, and forms and structuring of organisations. The course then proceeds to a review and discussion of major perspectives and research programmes in organisational analysis. The student is thus given an opportunity to develop an understanding of the central features of different perspectives as well as appreciating the nature of ongoing controversy and debate among competing viewpoints. The review of earlier traditions like scientific management, human relations and contingency theory are followed by critical perspectives of the time, namely Marxist and action frames of reference. More recent research traditions to be reviewed include resource dependence, institutionalist, and ecological perspectives as well as those that stem from neo-isntitutionalist economics and economic sociology. The course finally considers more recent alternative traditions like interpretive, critical realist, and postmodern approaches.",

    "summary": "In this course, some of the critical tools for comparative analysis will be introduced. The units of comparative analysis can vary. Sometimes what is compared is the historical transformation on the road to becoming nation-states which may shed some light onto different political regime outcomes in various countries. Comparative analysis is done through pattern depiction, for instance, in three different countries such as Germany, Italy, and Japan that have experienced fascist regimes. Students learn to see what these cases have in common in terms of their political transformation that explains the rise of fascism in these particular cases and not in others.  It is through such analyses that students equip themselves with tools towards making predictions about political regime changes. In sum, it is such tools that make political analysis possible. This course involves an analysis of the major modes of transformation and political modernization leading to various regime outcomes in the twentieth century. In the first part of the semester, the meaning of pre-modern and modern politics will be unraveled and particular state-formation and nation-building processes will be studied in the Western European context.  In the second part, some of the critical features of the emerging political ideologies that accompany these processes will be studied. The third part of the course will focus on comparative electoral systems, political party structures, the dynamics among the legislative, executive and judiciary bodies of government in key West European countries throughout the twentieth century.",

For instance, they consolidated their democracies later and, with the exception of Italy, joined the European Community around thirty years after its creation. This course will study the politics, society, and economy of Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Greece from a comparative perspective. First, the state structure, party politics, and electoral systems of the Southern European countries will be introduced. Second, the causes, policies, and the collapse of the interwar authoritarian regimes of Salazar, Franco, Mussolini, and Metaxas will be examined. In this context, special emphasis will be given to how democracy consolidated in Southern Europe. Continuing political problems, such as Basque nationalism in Spain, the Sicilian mafia in Italy, and the Muslim minority in Greece will also be discussed. Finally, the course will conclude with the entrance of the Southern European countries to the European Community, their policies and roles within the Union, and the effects of the EU on Southern Europe.",

    "summary": "This course studies Latin American Politics from theoretical and empirical perspectives. First, it will provide a short introduction to the history of Latin America based on major theoretical perspectives with a particular emphasis on the second half of the twentieth century and current context. Then, it will mainly focus on major political, social and economic institutions in the region, while studying intra-regional variation in this respect as well as the common patterns. It will examine the evolution of democratic regimes, military interventions, transitions and civil society politics from an institutionalist perspective, focusing on the so-called ''third wave'' of democratization processes in the region. The course will finally explore the politics of ongoing processes of regionalization within Latin America and between Latin America and other regions of the world. The politics and ideology behind the ideal of ''Latin American integration'' will be studied in this final section. The mail goal of this course is to expose students to substantive empirical issues and theoretical debates in the contemporary scholarship on Latin American politics.",

    "summary": "A major structural change has taken place in Turkish society with the urban population surpassing the rural population for the first time in the Ottoman-Turkish continuum. The first rate of urbanization has not resulted in a parallel process of urban integration, creating serious problems in both tangible (infrastructure, housing, services) and intangible (identity, participation, civic engagement) aspects of urban space. This dual character of urban settlements in Turkey has been compounded by a strained relationship between central and local govenment in sharing of competences and resources. The strategic decision of Turkey to join the European Union (EU); the need to harmonize policies; the prevalent trends and principles in the EU in the field of local govenment have created a new urgency to critically reappraise the administrative system in Turkey. The general tendency in the EU for decentralization, deconcentration and devolution, true to the spirit of local and regional governance, has necessitated local government reform to top the reform agenda in Turkey. Within the confines of the Course, a comparative analysis of existing institutions and processes will be taken up, followed by trends and evolving patterns of local governance in both the EU and Turkey.",

    "summary": "A major structural change has taken place in Turkish society with the urban population surpassing the rural population for the first time in the Ottoman-Turkish continuum. The first rate of urbanization has not resulted in a parallel process of urban integration, creating serious problems in both tangible (infrastructure, housing, services and intangible (identity, participation, civic engagement) aspects of urban space. This dual character of urban settlements in Turkey has been compounded by a strained relationship between central and local govenment in sharing of competences and resources. The strategic decision of Turkey to join the European Union (EU); the need to harmonize policies; the prevalent trends and principles in the EU in the field of local govenment have created a new urgency to critically reappraise the administrative system in Turkey. The general tendency in the EU for decentralization, deconcentration and devolution, true to the spirit of local and regional governance, has necessitated local government reform to top the reform agenda in Turkey. Within the confines of the Course, a comparative analysis of existing institutions and processes will be taken up, followed by trends and evolving patterns of local governance in both the EU and Turkey.",

    "summary": "Combining elements of social and economic anthropology with the history of political thought,the Humanity and society course at Sabancı University is both more dense in content, and analytical rather than narrative in approach.As against a smooth evolutionary continuity,it visualizes development and progress more in terms of a step -function of discrete (hunting-gathering,agricultural,and industrial) thresholds. These represent  the material -technical limits of the possible,setting agendas and posing problems ,to which social formations are perceived  as responding with not just one but a whole range of institutional solutions,each with its own mode(s) of ideological legitimation.Such combinations of forms of production,coercion and persuasion are further conceptualized as being nurtured in different environments and/or distinct cultural traditions.The two lectures per week are more contextual in character,while selected political -philosophical texts are taken up in the discussion section.",

The course will take advantage of the inherent multi-disciplinary nature of multimedia by covering the basics including; computer hardware and peripherals, file formats, resolution and color, screen composition, photography, graphic design, concept development, flowcharting, storyboarding, visualization techniques, presentation formats, production methods, desktop publishing and the principles of user interface design in general. No prior computer experience beyond the word processor is expected.",

Beginning with the conceptions of modern art and the artist, it critically explores the distinction between art works and artifacts, creativity and labor as well as between contemporary and 'ethnic' art. Drawing on ethnographic examples the course investigates how artists, critics, curators, collectors, patrons and sponsors conceptualize their work, and how they approach prospective audiences. A central concern will be analyzing how the philosophical underpinnings of the civic impact accorded to art are reflected in the daily 'business' of the art world. This will include looking at the practices and discourses of producing, curating and exhibiting; buying, selling, and collecting; reviewing, appraising, insuring and restituting artworks as well as probing the interpersonal and institutional relationships that constitute the arts sector.",

The influence of major art movements from the beginning and middle of the 20thCentury will be compared with late 20th Century art, contemporary visual practices and contemporary digital culture. Students will develop an understanding of curatorial and artistic practices as  well as an aesthetic vocabulary and familiarity with the practice based and theoretical issues related to contemporary art and curatorial practices.",

    "summary": "This course brings together a variety of readings from the humanities and the social sciences that examine the inner workings of the art world. Beginning with the conceptions of modern art and the artist, it critically explores the distinction between art works and artifacts, creativity and labor as well as between contemporary and 'ethnic' art. Drawing on ethnographic examples the course investigates how artists, critics, curators, collectors, patrons and sponsors conceptualize their work, and how they approach prospective audiences. A central concern will be analyzing how the philosophical underpinnings of the civic impact accorded to art are reflected in the daily 'business' of the art world. This will include looking at the practices and discourses of producing, curating and exhibiting; buying, selling, and collecting; reviewing, appraising, insuring and restituting artworks as well as probing the interpersonal and institutional relationships that constitute the arts sector.",
